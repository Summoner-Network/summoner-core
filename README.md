> The **Summoner Core SDK** is the foundation of the Summoner protocol, providing a minimal, composable runtime for building and coordinating autonomous agents.

This core SDK exposes the **hooks**, **communication layer**, and **execution model** needed to support decentralized identities, reputation-aware messaging, programmable automations, and orchestration.

## üìö Documentation

The core codebase is thoroughly documented in our **official documentation**, available on our GitHub page [here](https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-docs).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Before running the platform, ensure that both **Python** and **Rust** are installed on your system. The `setup.sh` script will then take care of configuring the environment and compiling necessary components.

### 1. Install Python

The platform requires **Python 3.9+**. You can check if Python is installed using:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If it is not installed, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or install via your package manager.

#### On macOS:

```bash
brew install python
```

#### On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip
```

### 2. Install Rust

The Rust-based servers depend on a working installation of the **Rust toolchain**.

Install Rust using `rustup`:

#### On macOS (via Homebrew):

```bash
brew install rustup
rustup-init
```

#### On macOS/Linux (via installer script):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

After installation, restart your terminal and verify:

```bash
rustc --version     # ‚úÖ Should print the Rust compiler version
cargo --version     # ‚úÖ Should print the Cargo package manager version
```

### 3. Run the Setup Script

Once Python and Rust are installed, `git clone` the default branch, for example by using 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Summoner-Network/summoner-core.git
```
and initialize the project environment by running:

```bash
source setup.sh
```

This script performs the following actions:

- Creates a **Python virtual environment** in the root directory (`venv`)
- Installs required **Python packages** listed in `requirements.txt`
- Generates a default **`.env`** file with configuration placeholders
- Installs all available **Rust server implementations**, using `Cargo.lock` to ensure consistent builds
- ‚ú® **[NEW]** Installs the `summoner` folder as a **Python package** in editable mode, enabling clean imports like `from summoner.server import *` without modifying `PYTHONPATH`


#### What This Means for Imports

With `summoner` installed as an editable pip package, you can write imports like:

```python
from summoner.server import SummonerServer
```

... without modifying your `PYTHONPATH`.

Previously, without a proper package installation, you needed boilerplate like:

```python
target_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), ".."))
if target_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, target_path)
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

The `.env` file defines key runtime parameters such as logging and database connection. You may need to adjust it to match your local setup:

```dotenv
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb
SECRET_KEY=supersecret
```

After editing `.env`, make sure these values are correctly read by the Python settings module (`summoner/settings.py`). It uses `os.getenv()` to load defaults:

```python
# summoner/settings.py
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL", "sqlite:///local.db")
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY", "devsecret")
```

At this point, your development environment should be fully configured and ready to use. You can now launch a server or run clients to explore and test the code.
